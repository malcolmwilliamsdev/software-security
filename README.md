Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

    Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that creates personalized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They sought to modernize their operations with enhanced software security, specifically requesting a file verification feature for secure data transfer in their web application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

    I effectively ran OWASP dependency checks to identify vulnerabilities, which is crucial because secure coding prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive data, adding immense value to a company’s trustworthiness and integrity.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    The challenging part was discerning false positives during the vulnerability assessment, which was also helpful as it improved my understanding of the security landscape and threat detection.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    I increased security by implementing an SSL server with a sha-256 hash certificate for HTTPS. For future assessments, I would use updated vulnerability databases and automated security scanning tools to determine the best mitigation strategies.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    To ensure functionality and security, I conducted static tests post-refactoring to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced, maintaining the integrity of the application.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

    I utilized secure coding practices, static analysis tools, and dependency checks. These practices are beneficial for maintaining security standards in future software development tasks.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

    From this assignment, I could demonstrate to future employers the successful integration of security measures into existing applications, showcasing my skills in secure software development and vulnerability assessment.
